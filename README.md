## ⚡ What I Do

I design and deploy **AI-powered automation systems** that eliminate repetitive work, unlock efficiency, and give businesses a real competitive edge. From intelligent agents to end-to-end workflow pipelines — I build it, ship it, and scale it.

- 🤖 **AI Agent Development** — Multi-agent systems using LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen
- 🔗 **LLM Integration** — OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Gemini & open-source model deployment
- ⚙️ **Workflow Automation** — n8n, Make, Zapier, custom API pipelines
- 🧠 **Prompt Engineering & RAG** — Production-grade retrieval systems and optimized prompting
- 🏗️ **AI Product Building** — From idea to deployed AI-powered SaaS or internal tool

## 🧩 How I Think About AI Automation

```
Problem  →  Map the workflow  →  Identify AI leverage points
        →  Design agent logic  →  Build · Test · Iterate
        →  Deploy · Monitor  →  Continuous improvement ♻️
```

Most people automate the **how**. I automate the **thinking** behind the how.
